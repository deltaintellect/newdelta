Every story I create, creates me. I write to create myself. -â€“ Octavia E. Butler

Beginning September 2021, I made a conscious effort to read good books every month. As a busy student with lots of ongoing research and assignments, one of the easiest and efficient way I can achieve this goal is by listening to audiobooks during my leisure time, while taking a walk, cooking or doing my laudary. Good audiobooks are expensive, however, there is a cheaper route.

Since I am a student at [The University of Alabama](www.ua.edu), I subscribed for an electronic library card from the [Tuscaloosa Public Library](https://www.tuscaloosa-library.org/). With the [Libby app](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) for android or ios, I can download and listen to countless books free of charge.

If you do not have a library card that delivers such service for free, there are lots of free audiobooks on Youtube and Google podcast. I recommend this [ youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnx0Cy6yigF_D2EYs9nGYww). Alternatively, you may also like paid services like [audible](https://www.audible.com/). 

There has been a great improvements in my life since I started this reading expedition. Reduced stress, anxiety, improved relationship, communication, ... Join me on this journey and let's explore and improve our lives.

Good Luck!
