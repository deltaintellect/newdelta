abstract: The transition from military to democratic rule has inter alia
  culminated in entrenching elections as a political culture. This has sparked
  longstanding debate about voting behavior determinants in Ghana. Therefore,
  this study probes voters behavior infleuncers using a conceptual model
  anchored on the theory of reasoned action. Data was drawn using
  questionnaires. Data (n = 401) analysis results using the structural equation
  modelling technique revealed a significant relationship between celebrity
  endorsement, ideology, manifesto and debate, and attitude. Further, celebrity
  endorsement, debate and attitude were revealed to significantly relate voters’
  voting intention. Given these outcomes, implications and suggestions for
  further research, are outlined.
