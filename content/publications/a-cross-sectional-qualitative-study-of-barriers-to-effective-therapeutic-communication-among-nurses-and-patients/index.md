abstract: Effective communication between patients and nurses is cardinal to
  health care The study seeks to explore barriers to effective therapeutic
  communication between patients and nurses in randomly selected health
  facilities in the Kumasi metropolis, Ashanti region, Ghana. The study employed
  an exploratory study to interview 60 respondents comprising 30 nurses and
  patients each, using an unstructured interview guide. In addition to nurses'
  and patients'perceived barriers, the study revealed the health
  environment–related barriers. Patients-related barriers include individual
  sociodemographic attributes, patient–nurse relationship, erroneous impression,
  and language barrier. Other identified nurses-related barriers include human
  resource challenges, patients' distrust in nurses’ competency, interference
  from patients’ relations, inadequate knowledge, patient’s dissatisfaction with
  output, patients’ emotional fluctuations. Health environment–related barriers
  also include excessive workload, unconducive environment, and environmental
  changes. Given the relevance of therapeutic communication to health service,
  the study, among other things recommends that efforts be exerted by sector
  actors to address the challenges and help promote quality in health-care
  service and delivery.
