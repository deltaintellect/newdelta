abstract: Health insurance policies have become key social policy interventions
  incepted to extend healthcare to vulnerable populations. In this vein, Ghana
  devised a health insurance scheme in the year 2003. However, there have been
  concerns about quality, value, satisfaction and trust regarding healthcare and
  insurance usage. Using data drawn from 345 participants, our study
  investigates these dimensions to empirically test their predictive effects on
  the actual usage of health insurance. Data analysis results using the
  Structural Equation Modelling technique confirmed these dimensions as
  predictors of intention and actual usage. Our study delineates the practical,
  theoretical and policy implications of the study findings.
