3x, 2 - x, 5b - 3a are examples of algebraic or variable expressions. They are made of numbers and variables. So, when you combine number(s) with variables like x, y, z etc., you form an algebraic expression, e.g., 5y, 7a etc. Sometimes, algebraic expressions are separated by operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and so on. An example is 2x-9.
