Consider the following binomial expressions, 

![eq01](01.png)

Now, the expansion becomes complex when we want to find, for example, $(x + y)^15$. 
So, we need a better alternative. This is where the binomial theorem comes in. 

That is, binomial theorem is a mathematical formula for expanding the binomial expression of the form $(x + y)^n$, for positive values of $n$. The formula is given by

The above expression can be rewritten as;
