abstract: The enormous potential inherent in the use of technological
  enhancements has subsequently informed the deployment of technologies into
  mainstream health service and delivery. However, a larger population of health
  technology consumers, specifically patients, are touted to be significantly
  constrained in its usage. Against this backdrop, our study employs an
  integrated model anchored on the technology acceptance model and the theory of
  planned behavior to investigate patients' electronic health use. Our study
  elicited data from 360 respondents, of which 311 were deemed feasible for the
  study. Structural equation modeling analysis of data revealed perceived
  usefulness and perceived ease of use has a relevant positive effect on
  attitude. Furthermore, the authors found; attitude, internet dependency,
  perceived behavioral control and the subjective norm also have a relevant
  positive impact on intention to use electronic health service. Premised on the
  findings, recommendations about enhancing consumer electronic health use and
  areas for further studies are successively delineated.
