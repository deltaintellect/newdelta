abstract: Food and agricultural policy research is often challenged with the
  issue of commercializing the application of transgenic technology in food
  production. There is a need for an enhanced understanding of how risk and
  benefit information influence the general attitudes of farmers towards
  genetically modified (GM) technology. This paper contributes to existing
  literature by studying the various adoption factors that influence Ghanaian
  farmers’ attitudes toward GM crop technology by using risk perception as a
  mediating tool. An empirical choice of methodology which is structural
  equation analysis was incorporated in this study. We report that, after
  conducting a survey among 325 respondents, Ghanaian farmers’ negative
  attitudes toward GM technology is as a result of the influence of risk
  perception on the attributes of the innovative technology (relative advantage,
  trialability, mass media, and interpersonal relations). We employ a conceptual
  framework that incorporates Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) and Risk
  analysis to assess the relationships between the attributes and attitudes
  towards GM technology. It was revealed in the structural equation modeling
  (SEM) analysis that, risk perception exerts a significant influence on the
  effects of the attributes of GM technology adoption thus reflecting a negative
  attitude towards the adoption of the related technology. We further discussed
  the implications for emphasizing the need for a positive attitude toward the
  acceptance and adoption of GM technology in Ghana.
