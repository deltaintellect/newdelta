abstract: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a surge in mask
  usage around the world. This situation could spur environmental consequences
  which when not well managed, may compound waste and waste management, and
  further drive the spread of viral infections. Therefore, this study explores
  the antecedents of mask waste separation behavior in Ghana using an integrated
  model composed of the theory of planned behavior and the norm activation
  model. With the use of the questionnaire survey approach, data was drawn from
  570 respondents, and further analyzed using the structural equation modeling
  technique. Results revealed that the relationship between awareness of
  consequences and other constructs, except attitude, and the relationship
  between ascription of responsibility and other constructs, except attitude,
  are significant. Moreover, significant relationships between subjective norm
  and attitude, subjective norm and personal norm, and subjective norm and
  perceived behavior control were validated. However, no significant
  relationship exists between awareness of consequences and attitude, and
  between awareness of responsibility and attitude. On the basis of the study
  findings, insightful implications for policy and suggestions for future
  research are presented.
