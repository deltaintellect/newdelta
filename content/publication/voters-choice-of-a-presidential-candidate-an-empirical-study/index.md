abstract: Since the consolidation of democracy and the inception of reforms
  thereof in Ghana, one raging subject matter that has over time come under
  intense scrutiny, and persistently, altogether eminently preoccupied the
  attention of political scientists, pollsters, marketers and strategists in
  particular, has been one bordering on voter's behavior. Understanding voter's
  behavior is crucially indispensable to reshaping the democratic process and
  devising political strategies. In spite of this, there is however a paucity of
  research focus targeted at unraveling the distinct behavior patterns and
  underpinnings relative to voters' choices. Against this backdrop, the main
  idea of this research is to explore the antecedents of voters' choice. The
  theory of consumer behavior has been used as the theoretical framework. Using
  the survey approach, data was elicited from card bearing registered voters and
  analyzed with the aid of the structural equation modeling technique. Results
  of data (n = 363) analysis revealed a confluence of voters' choice antecedents
  anchored on; quality, trust, attractiveness, expertise and image. Based on the
  results, study implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research
  are subsequently delineated.
