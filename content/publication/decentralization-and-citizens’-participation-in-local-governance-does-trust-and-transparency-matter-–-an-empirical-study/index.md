abstract: The wind of change that swept across the African continent and other
  developing countries ensuingly engendered the need to institute measures that
  would bring government to the people’s doorstep. This led to the
  prioritization and touting of decentralization. Against the backdrop of the
  proximate reason to accelerate public access to government, the express
  expectation was that a germane space would be created to enhance
  participation. However, the validity of this postulation is yet to be
  realized. The study, therefore, set out to examine the relationship between
  decentralization and people’s participation, with the mediating role of trust
  and transparency. Results of data analysis (561 respondents), using the
  structural equation modelling technique, established not only the
  appropriateness of the proposed study model, but also, the imperativeness of
  the trust and transparency to decentralization and participation. The
  implications of the study are delineated for effective policy and practice.
