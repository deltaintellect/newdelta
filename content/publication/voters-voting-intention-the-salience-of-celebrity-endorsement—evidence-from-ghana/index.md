abstract: Partly spurred by the notion that celebrities wield potentials
  leverageable for political gains, the phenomenon of celebrity endorsement has
  become emblematic of political campaigns. While the use of celebrities in
  politics is on the ascendancy, its impact on electoral fortunes in bourgeoning
  democracies like Ghana where the concept is nascent, has received little
  research focus. Considering the anticipated gains, an empirical investigation
  in this regard will be imperative to the politics of transitioning polities.
  Against this backdrop, our study investigates the salience of celebrity
  endorsement to voters' voting intention. Employing a questionnaire-drawn data
  via the survey method, with a sample of 745, results of data analysis anchored
  on the structural equation modeling technique revealed a significant positive
  relationship between endorser credibility and political brand credibility.
  Similarly, study results confirmed the significant positive relationship
  between political brand credibility and voting intention. Finally, the
  significant positive relationship between endorser credibility and voting
  intention was affirmed. Overall, the study outcomes verify the usefulness and
  appropriateness of the proposed model. Based on the results, implications for
  political strategy and suggestions for further research are subsequently
  delineated.
