abstract: The daunting global challenges saddling polities and governments alike
  have resultantly created a situation whereby governments and corporate civil
  society have inadvertently reneged on delivering public good and services to
  citizens. In ensuring and strengthening a publicâ€“private actor synergy, with
  particular emphasis on leveraging acquired knowledge and skills of
  diaspora-based students, social entrepreneurship activities could be harnessed
  to provide sustainable remedies to social challenges such as unemployment,
  famine amongst others by utilizing social entrepreneurship as a tool. Using
  the theory of planned behaviour as a theoretical framework, the study elicited
  data from 322 respondents to empirically investigate determinants of social
  entrepreneurship intentions of Ghanaian students, with the moderating role of
  institutional support. Study results revealed that sense of social
  responsibility and service learning have significant relationship with social
  entrepreneurship intention. However, social volunteering experience had no
  significant relationship. Moreover, whereas attitude to social
  entrepreneurship intention demonstrated a positive relationship, institutional
  support as a moderator was also revealed to influence the relationship between
  attitude and social entrepreneurship intention. From the study findings, we
  discourse on the implications for social entrepreneurship in Ghana to policy
  makers and stakeholders.
